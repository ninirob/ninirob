👋 Hi, I’m @ninirob

## Welcome to my GitHub! Here you’ll find projects that showcase my work in data analysis, software development, physics animation, and more!
-	👀 I’m interested in everything related to Computer Science…
-	🌱 I’m currently learning STEM at SNHU…
-	💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding in Python and Matplotlib animation…
-	⚡ Fun fact: Life is always good when you're learning
  
# 🧑‍💻 Projects
[Fleet Maintenance Visualization](https://github.com/ninirob/Fleet-Maintenance-DAD220):
- Analyzed data from a school provided Codio workspace for my DAD 220 course in SQL and created graphs using Matplotlib in Python to present to stakeholders.📊
  
[Phone Drop Analysis](https://github.com/ninirob/Phone-drop-PHY150):
- Created graphs to visualize phone drops with different material cases to prove which material is most effective, shown through graphs to stakeholders (PHY 150).📱💥

[Newton’s Third Law Free Body Diagram Foot Tapping To Music with Animation](https://github.com/ninirob/NewtonsThirdLawFBD): 
- Animated Newton’s third law of foot tapping to music, demonstrating symmetry in forces from the ground to the foot, and converted it into a GIF (PHY 150).🎶👣

[Text-Based Alien Game](https://github.com/ninirob/TextBasedGame):
- Python text-based game where the goal is to escape a spacecraft without encountering aliens, featuring ASCII art and item collection (IT 140).👽🎮

[Student Grade Management System](https://github.com/ninirob/StudentGradeManagementSystem):
- A personal project written in C to learn about data management and basic program structure. 💻📚
  
[Paint Gallon Calculator](https://github.com/ninirob/Paint-gallon-calculator-IT145/blob/main/src/Paint2.java):
- A simple paint calculator written in Java for my IT 145 class to calculate the amount of paint needed based on wall size.🎨🖌️
