## 👋 Hi, I’m @ninirob

## Welcome to my GitHub! Here you’ll find projects that showcase my work in data analysis, software development, physics animation, and more!
-	👀 I’m interested in everything related to Computer Science…
-	🌱 I’m currently learning STEM at SNHU…
-	💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding in Python and Matplotlib animation…
-	⚡ Fun fact: Life is always good when you're learning! 
  
# 🧑‍💻 Projects
[Fleet Maintenance Visualization](https://github.com/ninirob/Fleet-Maintenance-DAD220)📊:
- Analyzed data from a school provided Codio workspace for my DAD 220 course in SQL and created graphs using Matplotlib in Python to present to stakeholders.
  
[Phone Drop Analysis](https://github.com/ninirob/Phone-drop-PHY150)📱💥:
- Created graphs to visualize phone drops with different material cases to prove which material is most effective, shown through graphs to stakeholders (PHY 150).

[Newton’s Third Law Free Body Diagram Foot Tapping To Music with Animation](https://github.com/ninirob/NewtonsThirdLawFBD)🎶👣: 
- Animated Newton’s third law of foot tapping to music, demonstrating symmetry in forces from the ground to the foot, and converted it into a GIF (PHY 150).

[Text-Based Alien Game](https://github.com/ninirob/TextBasedGame)👽🎮:
- Python text-based game where the goal is to escape a spacecraft without encountering aliens, featuring ASCII art and item collection (IT 140).

[Student Grade Management System](https://github.com/ninirob/StudentGradeManagementSystem)💻📚:
