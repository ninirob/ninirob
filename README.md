## 👋 Hi, I’m @ninirob

## Welcome to my GitHub! Here you’ll find projects that showcase my work in data analysis, software development, physics animation, and more!
-	👀 I’m interested in everything related to Computer Science…
-	🌱 I’m currently learning STEM at SNHU…
-	💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding in Python and Matplotlib animation…
-	⚡ Fun fact: Life is always good when you're learning! 
  
# 🧑‍💻 Projects

[Chada Digital Clock](https://github.com/ninirob/CS210ChadaClocks): 
- This project simulates a digital clock application that displays the current time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats simultaneously. Users can interact with the clock through a menu to increment hours, minutes, or seconds. 
The program updates both time formats accordingly and handles proper rollover for each unit of time

[Fleet Maintenance Visualization](https://github.com/ninirob/Fleet-Maintenance-DAD220)📊:
- Analyzed data from a school provided Codio workspace for my DAD 220 course in SQL and created graphs using Matplotlib in Python to present to stakeholders.
  
[Phone Drop Analysis](https://github.com/ninirob/Phone-drop-PHY150)📱💥:
- Created graphs to visualize phone drops with different material cases to prove which material is most effective, shown through graphs to stakeholders (PHY 150).

[Newton’s Third Law Free Body Diagram Foot Tapping To Music with Animation](https://github.com/ninirob/NewtonsThirdLawFBD)🎶👣: 
- Animated Newton’s third law of foot tapping to music, demonstrating symmetry in forces from the ground to the foot, and converted it into a GIF (PHY 150).

[Text-Based Alien Game](https://github.com/ninirob/TextBasedGame)👽🎮:
- Final Python project was a text-based game where the goal is to escape a spacecraft without encountering aliens, featuring ASCII art and item collection (IT 140).
- Also showcases a Higher or Lower guessing game and prior code to set up the foundational logic for Final Alien game. 

[Student Grade Management System](https://github.com/ninirob/StudentGradeManagementSystem)💻📚:
- A personal project written in C to learn about data management and basic program structure. 
  
[Paint Gallon Calculator](https://github.com/ninirob/Paint-gallon-calculator-IT145/blob/main/src/Paint2.java)🎨🖌️:
- A simple paint calculator written in Java for my IT 145 class to calculate the amount of paint needed based on wall size.

Feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you’d like to collaborate on any of them or have any suggestions! Thank you! 😊
